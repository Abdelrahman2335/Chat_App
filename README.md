After moving the Android SDK from the default C:\ drive to D:\, Gradle and Flutter builds began failing due to outdated paths pointing to the old SDK location.

üõ†Ô∏è Issue Summary
The build system was still trying to access:

D:\Android\Sdk\cmake\3.22.1\bin\ninja.exe
This caused build failures and missing dependencies during debug mode in:


D:\Repository\Chat_App\android\app\.cxx\Debug
‚úÖ Solution Steps
Update All SDK Paths

Locate and update all references to the old SDK path in:

local.properties

Any .gradle or .cxx cache/config

System environment variables (ANDROID_HOME, PATH, etc.)

Important Commands Used

flutter run --verbose
Showed detailed logs and helped pinpoint the exact path and tool causing the issue.

.\gradlew.bat clean
Cleaned old Gradle build files and rebuilt everything from scratch.

.\gradlew --stop
Stopped any running Gradle daemon that might have cached the old SDK path.

‚úÖ Final Notes
Always verify and update paths in:

local.properties

Environment variables (JAVA_HOME, ANDROID_SDK_ROOT)

If things break again, use:

flutter run --verbose

flutter doctor -v

These are your best tools to track and resolve Android build issues quickly.
